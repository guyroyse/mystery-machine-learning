Fred Jones,we also paid a visit to your trailer when you said youd be there you were nowhere to be found
Fred Jones,why dont you ask them yourself
Fred Jones,right thats when you made a plan to get around those rules and make sure youd win this years contest
Fred Jones,but the crowd wouldnt see two skinny dudes close out the festival instead wildwind would come on stage and perform
Fred Jones,easy shaggy their mountain climbing equipment
Fred Jones,they rigged it to the stage so they could swoop down and kidnap the acts
Fred Jones,thats the answer we dont have
Fred Jones,where are the hex girls now
Fred Jones,they knew wed keep looking until we found you making us miss our chance to perform
Fred Jones,daniels right mr illiwara wildwind is definitely human
Fred Jones,we got an explanation for that too
Fred Jones,they used pictures of the yowie yahoo to help pull off their hoax they placed the pictures on holographic disks
Fred Jones,to make the yowie yahoo even more realistic they added fire wind and explosions
Fred Jones,bingo shaggy

Fred Jones,we got a mystery on our hands
Fred Jones,and whatever it was wed scared it away

Fred Jones,dont worry no matter how huge ferocious or bloodthirsty this vicious chupacabra monster may be well get to the bottom of the mystery
Fred Jones,um muchas gracias para su hospital y cometas

Fred Jones,daphne
Fred Jones,hey not so fast you two
Fred Jones,where could they have gone
Fred Jones,let me see that
Fred Jones,my guess is that it will take us right to daphne and her kidnappers it sure looks like the perfect getaway
Fred Jones,come on guys theres no turning back now
Fred Jones,its the pyramid of the feathered serpent the good god we saw a statue of at the curanderos tent
Fred Jones,daphne dont move well be right there
Fred Jones,lets get out of here before they come back for you

Fred Jones,dont worry shaggy everything in here is dead
Fred Jones,trying to attack you
Fred Jones,come on guys we better get of here before these mysterious mischievous makers try to taught themselves
Fred Jones,yes butll be more productive if we first get all our facts straight
Fred Jones,i think the village is being terrorized for a reason somebody wants him to scare everyone off and get us out of the way
Fred Jones,if the oteros are forced to sale señor fuente gets what he wants the oteros land
Fred Jones,the footprints leading away from the cottage suggested el chupacabra was scared off when shaggy alerted the rest of us
Fred Jones,yeah theyre anticipating our every move but how
Fred Jones,wait freeze that frame look whoever wrote mañana a spanish word for tomorrow forgot the tilde
Fred Jones,its a symbol you put over the n to change the pronunciation without it the word would be said as manana instead of mañana a mistake no real spanish speaking person would ever make
Fred Jones,oh uh muchas gracias
Fred Jones,maybe but theres always the possibility theres more than one bad guy
Fred Jones,can i see your medallion just as i thought its a tracking device lets see if it works in reverse
Fred Jones,cant you see many of them dont understand your foreign language speaking spanish might help
Fred Jones,its mr smiley
Fred Jones,their hotel is built on some of the best real estate in veracruz when they refused to sell well he wouldnt take no for an answer
Fred Jones,smiley was the only person to pull it off
Fred Jones,being the head of a theme park he had access to the best special effects money can buy

Daphne Blake,but whats to be gained from that
Daphne Blake,good point but what does that have to do with el chupacabra
Daphne Blake,i dont we can roll out the supernatural
Daphne Blake,if the creatures at the pyramids were special affects they were pretty special
Daphne Blake,velma did you save the torn label from the fake warriors costume
Daphne Blake,officers
Daphne Blake,so he terrorize the tourists with the chupachapra attacks hoping to ruin the oteros hotel business and force them to sell
Daphne Blake,and by kidnapping me and framing us as vandals he was able to derail our investigation and create bad publicity for the pyramids
Daphne Blake,it sure doesnt look like a special effect to me
Daphne Blake,hardly it takes two to tango
Daphne Blake,so guess there never was a real chupacabra i wonder how that myth got started
Daphne Blake,this dust storms really picking up

Daphne Blake,sure is great to see you again mr and mrs jones
Velma Dinkley,really how can you tell
Velma Dinkley,we are you know how i like reading in a foreign language listen to this gang climbers on mount everest claim to have seen the abominable snowman a mysterious creature believed to exist in the high himalayas
Velma Dinkley,i hear you can i have my cheeks back
Velma Dinkley,home to mount everest and the headline making mystery of the abominable snowman
Velma Dinkley,sorry daphne but it looks like youre trading in your new heels for snowshoes
Velma Dinkley,not abdominal freddie its pronounced abominable
Velma Dinkley,there are a number of different theories regarding the abominable snowman and there have been many photographs taken of the yetis footprints
Velma Dinkley,the yeti is the name used by the local mountain people to describe the creature
Velma Dinkley,not subliminal fred now youve got me all mixed up
Velma Dinkley,here we go again
Velma Dinkley,this is the life
Velma Dinkley,great formed daphne
Velma Dinkley,hey everybody come take a look sydney harbor
Velma Dinkley,this guidebook says sydney has the best restaurants in the entire southern hemisphere
Velma Dinkley,better eat now guys weve got sightseeing to do and pictures to take say vegemite
Velma Dinkley,what an incredible view
Velma Dinkley,the sydney harbour bridge is the worlds largest free standing bridge
Velma Dinkley,thats the sydney opera house its the citys most famous landmark
Velma Dinkley,thats the idea shaggy
Velma Dinkley,be right here freddie
Velma Dinkley,come here you guys ive got a great idea
Velma Dinkley,how do you guys feel about exploring the outback
Velma Dinkley,my guidebook says it makes up almost 85 percent of the continent
Velma Dinkley,and ive got 17 rolls of film to capture it all
Velma Dinkley,vampire rock is located right in the middle of australia we can see a lot of the outback on our way there
Velma Dinkley,and theres no such thing as vampires
Velma Dinkley,arent you guys ever gonna stop playing that game
Velma Dinkley,youd be surprised shaggy the outback is full of life
Velma Dinkley,there it is vampire rock
Velma Dinkley,it says the locals call it vampire rock because they believe the yowie yahoo lives in the rock caves
Velma Dinkley,an ancient australian vampire
Velma Dinkley,i already told you guys theres no such thing as a vampire
Velma Dinkley,how long have you girls been here
Velma Dinkley,have you seen anything strange since you arrived
Velma Dinkley,what did your grandfather mean by terrible things
Velma Dinkley,what happened to them
Velma Dinkley,theres no such thing as vampires you said it yourself daniel
Velma Dinkley,when did this all start daniel
Velma Dinkley,well need to investigate this from the inside
Velma Dinkley,how do rockstars walk in these
Velma Dinkley,im not good at those either
Velma Dinkley,i hope we dont have to play at all
Velma Dinkley,not in front of so many people i get stage fright
Velma Dinkley,makeup
Velma Dinkley,you must be the bad omens
Velma Dinkley,russell told us about another band you used to manage wildwind
Velma Dinkley,lets get out of these costumes and start looking for clues
Velma Dinkley,the bad omens
Velma Dinkley,you think he put them up to it
Velma Dinkley,maybe we should talk to daniel and russell and find out more about them
Velma Dinkley,fred
Velma Dinkley,but fred
Velma Dinkley,fred
Velma Dinkley,or we could just use the front door
Velma Dinkley,this is better than a museum
Velma Dinkley,in more ways than one
Velma Dinkley,jinkies
Velma Dinkley,i think i already found one
Velma Dinkley,this looks exactly like the costume dark skull of wildwind wore in that poster
Velma Dinkley,so jasper ridgeway has reproductions of all the wildwind costumes interesting
Velma Dinkley,it smells so sweet like cotton candy
Velma Dinkley,what happened to the bad omens
Velma Dinkley,you actually saw the wildwind vampires shaggy
Velma Dinkley,we can take turns standing watch
Velma Dinkley,would you each do it for a scooby snack
Velma Dinkley,jasper seemed to forget about the bad omens pretty quickly
Velma Dinkley,i pulled up more research on vampires
Velma Dinkley,lets see vampires hate sunlight they cant cross running water and get this: the more people a vampire puts under his control the greater his power becomes
Velma Dinkley,it also says vampires dont appear on film when their pictures are taken
Velma Dinkley,daniel was telling us that you know all about the yowie yahoo legend mr illiwara
Velma Dinkley,perform
Velma Dinkley,jinkies
Velma Dinkley,they must be heading to vampire rock
Velma Dinkley,its going to be harder finding the hex girls than we thought
Velma Dinkley,vampire rock seems to be just that solid rock
Velma Dinkley,hmmm right now we should be experiencing total cave darkness but were not so
Velma Dinkley,these lanterns didnt light themselves
Velma Dinkley,they also used the equipment this fan is still warm
Velma Dinkley,and where
Velma Dinkley,what a mess
Velma Dinkley,if she is shes not alone
Velma Dinkley,daphne my glasses i lost my glasses thanks freddie i was getting worried now i am worried
Velma Dinkley,wherever daphne is shes a lot safer than we are
Velma Dinkley,not if we dont get out of here
Velma Dinkley,i feel the same way scooby
Velma Dinkley,the sun is almost up
Velma Dinkley,if he doesnt the sun will destroy him
Velma Dinkley,how about that scooby youre an honorary dingo
Velma Dinkley,thats because theyre not real vampires if they were they wouldnt have been captured on film
Velma Dinkley,at first we thought the bad omens were behind all this but when they disappeared we had to search for new suspects
Velma Dinkley,it took us a while to put all the pieces together when we saw jasper getting so chummy with the two skinny dudes we thought he might be the third vampire
Velma Dinkley,you managed the bad omens jasper we thought you took some of their makeup so you and the two skinny dudes could copy wildwinds glam rock look
Velma Dinkley,the three of them took advantage of the local legend surrounding them and disguised themselves as vampires they planned to kidnap all the other bands in the contest then two skinny dudes would be declared the winner
Velma Dinkley,they hoped the attention from closing the show at vampire rock would make their careers take off
Velma Dinkley,what about the hex girls they werent your competition
Velma Dinkley,they used smoke whenever they flew so no one could see their climbing ropes you helped us figure that part out sir
Velma Dinkley,wildwind spent a lot of time perfecting their act theyre masters of special effects
Velma Dinkley,when light was shined through the disks three dimensional images of the yowie yahoo were created these images could be beamed anywhere to help wildwind with their plan
Velma Dinkley,thanks to scooby we were able to solve the mystery
Velma Dinkley,does this mean what i think it means
Velma Dinkley,im not having a good time
Velma Dinkley,but theres so many people besides we dont even have a name for our group
Velma Dinkley,jinkies daphne it must be exciting to visit blake castle the ancient home of your scottish ancestors
Velma Dinkley,are you by chance referring to the legend of the loch ness monster
Velma Dinkley,im not so sure about that
Velma Dinkley,i believe its a mystery this monster is different there have been over 2000 loch ness monster sightings dating all the way back to 540 ad thats almost 1500 years ago
Velma Dinkley,we got to solve this mystery tonight and i know just the person to help us do it professor pembrooke come in professor do you read me
Velma Dinkley,she couldnt way down at the end of the loch right now
Velma Dinkley,jinkies you have mail
Velma Dinkley,mexico the art the mesuems the pyramids i’m there
Velma Dinkley,do you realize we’ll be there for the annual of the day of the dead celebration
Velma Dinkley,a holiday in which family gather at the cemetery and celebrat their ancestors who are allow to come back to earth for two days
Velma Dinkley,actually
Velma Dinkley,it didn’t take scooby to start livin’ la vida mocha
Velma Dinkley,the purpose of fiestas and siestas shaggy is to provide sustenance and rest for another tradition: hard work
Velma Dinkley,con man
Velma Dinkley,we were hoping to watch the preparations of day of the dead festivities
Velma Dinkley,i’ve read about him he’s mexico’s version of the bigfoot
Velma Dinkley,and what was all that noise
Velma Dinkley,oh no you dont this is no time to be chicken its all for one and one for all
Velma Dinkley,i dont think so i dont know what it is
Velma Dinkley,good idea fred we can videotape them
Velma Dinkley,back to you
Velma Dinkley,hold on you two we came here today to get to the bottom of this chupacabra mystery
Velma Dinkley,looks like they need some friendly persuasion would you each do it for a scooby snack
Velma Dinkley,great so far it appears as if the chupacabra is nocturnal now that its getting dark we should do a thorough search of the town
Velma Dinkley,yes of quetzalcoatl the feathered serpent ive read about him he was revered by the aztecs as the god of all things good
Velma Dinkley,wow are you a medicine man
Velma Dinkley,we were hoping you can tell us something about el chupacabra
Velma Dinkley,greed but what does this have to do with el chupacabra
Velma Dinkley,we better get back to the others and warn them
Velma Dinkley,thats polaris the north star we should be headed in the opposite direction
Velma Dinkley,it looks like the woods get thicker up ahead
Velma Dinkley,mostly coyotes and jaguars and boars
Velma Dinkley,and boars
Velma Dinkley,like maybe that
Velma Dinkley,jinkies el chupacubra
Velma Dinkley,but crate fluoid it isnt someone must have tampered with the brakes on the mystery machine
Velma Dinkley,shaggy
Velma Dinkley,jinkies perfect timing if you and the others havent show up when you did we be mexican history
Velma Dinkley,look what better place than a museum to learn about the past
Velma Dinkley,shes gone
Velma Dinkley,we cant leave here until we find daphne
Velma Dinkley,look at this it looks like some sort of ripped label from one of the warriors costumes mile enter i wonder what that means
Velma Dinkley,look a trap door
Velma Dinkley,look heres a door
Velma Dinkley,ive read about these the pyramids were created by the olmec indians who built mesoamericas first great civilization
Velma Dinkley,look at the top its daphne
Velma Dinkley,what happened to you
Velma Dinkley,thats odd that statue wasnt here before
Velma Dinkley,no guys actually they are scopions
Velma Dinkley,jinkies we must be in the ancient tombs
Velma Dinkley,look we can disguise ourselves by wearing the traditional clothing of the native indian skeletons
Velma Dinkley,magical eagle huh i didnt buy this animatronic impostor for one minute
Velma Dinkley,jinkies and she is still missing
Velma Dinkley,el chupacabra is scaring off the tourists making businesses suffer
Velma Dinkley,maybe hes a fake
Velma Dinkley,real or fake somebodys been following us
Velma Dinkley,lets look at me video tape again
Velma Dinkley,looks like your spanish lessons are finally paid off
Velma Dinkley,sure did but i still dont know what it means
Velma Dinkley,we suspected that mile and enter are part of bigger words and look we were right smiley entertainment when mister smiley was unable to convince the locals to sell their land for his new theme park he turned to the otero family
Velma Dinkley,and then he did everything he could to prevent us from revealing his scheme
Velma Dinkley,seen to be his chief competitor for the dollars of tourists all over the world
Velma Dinkley,im beginning to
Velma Dinkley,hmm i seem to recall someone mention coffee grinds coming out of their ears from working at the café all day
Velma Dinkley,like all myths i guess since the beginning of time men and women have loved to tell stories and what better reason for creating them than to explain the many things we dont understand and maybe never will
Velma Dinkley,would you guys mind keeping it down were trying to get some sleep back here
Velma Dinkley,what was that thing
Velma Dinkley,was it some kind of jet
Velma Dinkley,looks like the radiators finished
Velma Dinkley,thats a very brave thing to do scooby thank you
Velma Dinkley,now what
Velma Dinkley,have you seen them too
Velma Dinkley,wow
Velma Dinkley,um excuse me but we understand that youve had some contact with aliens

Velma Dinkley,gotta be quicker on the draw there scooby
Velma Dinkley,could we see them
Velma Dinkley,well we know we saw something
Velma Dinkley,they send and monitor messages to and from space hoping to find intelligent life
Velma Dinkley,maybe but there may be a connection between those dishes and the aliens i think we should investigate
Velma Dinkley,i think i know
Velma Dinkley,and is her golden retriever wonderful too scooby
Velma Dinkley,i think theyre seriously in l o v e
Velma Dinkley,daphne and crystal and her dog

Velma Dinkley,and all that motor oil max said was for the salf dishesits the wrong kind for hydraulics
Velma Dinkley,yeah
Velma Dinkley,mr sunshine
Velma Dinkley,i dont know but he sure is suspicious

Velma Dinkley,these rocks are wet
Velma Dinkley,lets see
Velma Dinkley,looks like some kind of mine
Velma Dinkley,i think its
Velma Dinkley,you can give up the hokey alien charade now steve
Velma Dinkley,you three give scientists a bad name you should be doing your jobs instead of looking for gold
Velma Dinkley,but i still dont see how you could have dug all this out

Velma Dinkley,twenty years is an impressive record
Velma Dinkley,thanks for keeping shaggy and scooby from glowing in the dark
Velma Dinkley,fred daphne and oh hi
Velma Dinkley,a mystery
Velma Dinkley,jinkies you mean you can transport objects from the real world into the computer world
Velma Dinkley,computer viruses dont just appear they have to be created by someone
Velma Dinkley,of course its so simple
Velma Dinkley,he used the scooby game as the location in cyberspace to store physical objects
Velma Dinkley,jinkies
Velma Dinkley,wow
Velma Dinkley,no more arguing boys
Velma Dinkley,so what can we do to help eric
Velma Dinkley,would you do it for a scooby snack

Velma Dinkley,what are you doing scooby
Velma Dinkley,sorry but we have to go
Velma Dinkley,cyber i guess this is goodbye
Velma Dinkley,i think so
Velma Dinkley,glad you agree professor because youre as much a suspect as anyone here
Velma Dinkley,but once inside the game we found some important clues
Velma Dinkley,but our biggest clue was on the final level
Velma Dinkley,so you invented the phantom virus hoping it would scare eric away
Velma Dinkley,i dont believe it youre ben ravencroft the famous horror writter
Velma Dinkley,and griswald disgruntled archaeologists from the museums babylonian project they were upset with you for cutting their funding dr dean
Velma Dinkley,mr ravencroft i am a huge fan of your work i have read all your books in which my opinion are the best horror stories ever written
Velma Dinkley,you know my name
Velma Dinkley,oh please what we do pales in comparation with the sheer ponderable fright of your novels
Velma Dinkley,i mean take the dead mole for example; oh that creepy jewerly store owner was an incredibly complex character
Velma Dinkley,really oh that would be great uh wouldnt it gang
Velma Dinkley,and that scene at the end where the caretakers flesh dissolved was so brilliant i 
Velma Dinkley,already
Velma Dinkley,i thought you said this was a quiet little town
Velma Dinkley,jinkies looks like you got a ghost in your own backyard ben
Velma Dinkley,this is amazing mayor
Velma Dinkley,so you say a ghost has been appearing here
Velma Dinkley,just like the salem witch trials many men and women who were a bit different or didnt conform to the codes of the colony suffer the same fate
Velma Dinkley,wow would we ever shaggy well meet up with you later
Velma Dinkley,wow so this is where it all started
Velma Dinkley,jinkies this is a dream come true
Velma Dinkley,id reed about them wiccans were people who were in turned with the forces of nature and use them for healing purposes
Velma Dinkley,hey i saw a huge oak tree like that in the town square
Velma Dinkley,wiccans have been misunderstood accused of sorcery in fact the word witch comes from wicca
Velma Dinkley,is there anything left in the kitchen
Velma Dinkley,bens already gone ahead
Velma Dinkley,whats going on guys
Velma Dinkley,you saw the witchs ghost
Velma Dinkley,hmm you said she threw fire balls right
Velma Dinkley,is this the street she chased you guys
Velma Dinkley,this is getting interesting ben
Velma Dinkley,lets go see
Velma Dinkley,yeah very mystifying
Velma Dinkley,ill say

Velma Dinkley,never mind it is a good idea you guys stay here we wanna take another look at where the guys saw that ghost
Velma Dinkley,come on
Velma Dinkley,lets take a look behind these trees

Velma Dinkley,he did there goes my cherry picker theory
Velma Dinkley,like what
Velma Dinkley,sorry about that mayor scooby and shaggy just lose it when they get scared in fact im worried that staying in oakhaven might just be too frightening and experienced for them i think we should leave
Velma Dinkley,but i need to get one more clue before the night is over then i think ill can solve the mystery of the witchs ghost before tomorrows autumns fest
Velma Dinkley,heres what were going to do
Velma Dinkley,help me i have fallen and i cant get up now yes you did it guys
Velma Dinkley,maybe i can explain i found flash powder residue where shag and scoob saw the ghost this is the device to throw the fireballs which was just watts of flash paper he got it from his daughters stage prompts
Velma Dinkley,its the cherry picker that made the ghost flie above the trees with the use of an extention device and theres the fan that created the eerie wind it took more than one person to pull of this scam isnt that right jack
Velma Dinkley,it would take someone pretty strong to hoist mr mcnight around
Velma Dinkley,that goes for all of you
Velma Dinkley,sure there had to be more people involved to make this hoax work
Velma Dinkley,shaggy you still have the shoe buckel scooby found today
Velma Dinkley,scooby can you show me exactly where you found this
Velma Dinkley,right i believe this is was left of the tree where sarah did her healing you never even noticed it because it was cut down hundreds of years ago its up to you to dig it scooby
Velma Dinkley,then how about a scooby snax
Velma Dinkley,two scooby snax
Velma Dinkley,the box
